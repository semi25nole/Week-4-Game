# Week-4-Game

Git Clone to see an example of an RPG game using Jquery. 

The concept of the game is simple; there are 4 crystals on the page. They all have a random value assigned to them; but together will add up to the target #. If your value equals the target #, you win! If your value goes over the target #, you lose!

Enjoy!
